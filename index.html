			<h1>Charity Endurance Racing</h1>
			<h2>Proposal for Sponsorship</h2>
			<p><strong>Each year, Killarney International Raceway in sunny Cape Town, South Africa hosts the annual endurance racing series for lightweight motorcycles. With either a 150cc 4 stroke single cylinder or 80cc 2 stroke, teams of 2-4 riders compete to do the most laps in a given amount of time.</strong></p>
			<p>With 4 races on the calendar, three of which 4 hours each and the final being the big 8hr event in December, the bikes and riders are really put to the test of fitness, tenacity and endurance.</p>
			<h2>How you can help</h2>
			<p>Being one of the most affordable forms of motorsport, most competitors are only partially sponsored or self sponsored. The idea behind our team however is to make use of the series to raise money for a charity of your choice by having you <strong>pledge an amount per lap for each event.</strong></p>

			<p>With a small basic amount per race, we’re able to keep the bike running fast, riders safe and the lap numbers high. </p>

			<p>Following each race, we’ll give you the official timesheets with all the information of every lap, including the totals and you will make a donation to the charity of your choice at the pledged amount multiplied by the total number of laps.</p>
